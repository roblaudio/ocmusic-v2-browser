# Obby Creator Music Song Browser Version 2

The Obby Creator Music Song Browser just before it's end of life. Manually
ported over from Roblox Studio.

> [!WARNING]
> The code sucks. It was written two years ago mostly by
> [nexpid](https://github.com/nexpid).
>
> Also, you will either need the Roblaudio application (unreleased for now) OR
> manually reupload every single audio in the Obby Creator Music group and
> give the compiled build universe permissions.
>
> We will not give you advice on how to set this up. We have no clue either.

Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.4.4.
